description: Learn how to self-host Hopp and publish your own version.

We are planning to provide self-hosting options in the future. The model we are thinking will be to provide an option to use the already built Hopp app, but have your own backend server, so you can configure Hopp to point to this backend.

⚠️ Still work in progress, if you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/TKRpS3aMn9).
