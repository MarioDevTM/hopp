Rooms are spaces where you can just hop-in and start collaborating with your teammates. Rooms allow more than 2 users to collaborate in a single call, and do not request a call request to be made.

## How to join a room?

To join a room, for now only the `Watercooler` room is available, navigate inside the app to the Room tab, and click on the `Watercooler` room.
