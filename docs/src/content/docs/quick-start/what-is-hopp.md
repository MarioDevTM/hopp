Hopp is the best open-source remote pair programming app. You can use it for seamless remote collaboration with your teammates.

##### 1. Ultra-low latency and crystal-clear image

As developers, we lose focus when we pair with our teammates and see everything with even a minor delay. It
just doesn't feel native.

Our latency, [which is affected by many factors](https://gethopp.app/blog/latency-exploration), should always be kept to a
minimum for the best possible pairing experience. We support 4K streaming so it feels like working on your own computer, without
grain. Unlike traditional tools where you might need to bump your IDE's font size from `14px` to `28px` to be readable,
Hopp preserves clarity at native sizes.

##### 2. Advanced input

When we pair and want to use our keyboard to type on a sharer's computer, we expect basic shortcuts to work—like
`Shift+a` to type an `A` character.

Scrolling also feels natural remotely.

##### 3. Remote control

Take complete control of your teammate's computer so it feels like working on the same computer side by side.

##### 4. Crystal-clear audio

High-quality, low-latency audio keeps conversation natural while you code together.

##### 5. Fast start

Start pairing in two clicks—no setup or meeting codes.

## Our mission

While there are high-quality proprietary tools for remote pair programming like Tuple and coscreen, we couldn't find
an open-source option of comparable quality. That's why we decided to build Hopp. High-quality remote collaboration tools
shouldn't be a luxury. Our goal is to make Hopp as good as the proprietary tools and why not even better with the
help of the community.

To achieve this, we are building a sustainable business around Hopp. Paid plans make it possible for us to dedicate our
full focus and best efforts to improving Hopp for the long term, while keep everything free and open-source. By choosing a
paid option, you directly support the future of open, accessible remote collaboration.
